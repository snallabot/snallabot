### Snallabot Dashboard

Once the bot has been added to your discord do the following:

1. Run `/dashboard` and click on the link to open your snallabot dashboard

3. Once you reach your dashboard, in the export options `All Weeks` and hit export. It should take a minute but snallabot will retrieve all the info it needs.
4. The bot is all setup to use, follow our [feature setup](feature_setup.md) for more features!

Every SEASON of your league, head to the dashboard and export All Weeks or in discord `/export all_weeks`
